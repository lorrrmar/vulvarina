In the above picture the squad is watching Coman miss the first penalty shoot-out. Tchouameni (#8) watched too closely and missed his too. How disappointing. Happens. What struck me was the unconditional support they gave each other. This love wall they built. All the pressure in the world is on one of them and they stand behind hugging each other. I have learned that very many things in life can be explained using football analogies. Sports in general display human behaviour very accurately. Men supporting men and allowing each other to screw up. Because to err is human. But not female. Rule number one - do not make mistakes as a girl. A few weeks ago, a female friend, who is a civil engineer, was talking about the hurdles of working on a construction site at the beginning of your career, when your experience is limited. The man in the room rushed to say, that it is ok to not know everything, make mistakes and learn as you go. If only we would all have a penis. </p><p>An <a href="https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/sarsons/files/sarsons_jmp.pdf">Harvard 2017 paper </a>discovered that following the death of a patient, male surgeons did not experience any decline in physician referrals, while female surgeons received 54 % fewer referrals. Even worse -  all female surgeons in that speciality suffered a referral decrease. Elizabeth Holmes - an ex biotech founder, who raised around 1 billion dollars for her startup and recently got sentenced for fraud - used to wear black turtlenecks. This is a no-go outfit for foundresses now. F that. My muji cashmere blend top is my most worn piece and not planning to give that up, just because one other woman fucked up. But these are real concerns women have, because these are the things that impact our careers. Just recently, Ahana Banerjee, wrote a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ahana-banerjee_licreatoraccelerator-leadership-womeninbusiness-activity-7003683058772025344-zb7K?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop">Linkedin pos</a>t about how trust in female leaders is going down, because of unconscious bias and how she cannot wait to be able to rewear her black turtleneck, because not all women should be punished for the mistakes of one. This woman is a physics graduate from Imperial College London. She got into Y Combinator with her company and raised around $1M in venture funding. She won 2022 L'Oréal Beauty Tech for Good. And wait for it - she is only 23 years old. How incredible are all these achievements and how cruel to prohibit her from wearing whatever she wants. How cruel to make her double think about such mundane things. And how unpractical. How much further could she be, if these things were of no concern to her? </p><p>One morning, after one of the many Christmas dinners that ended with too many drinks, I woke up and while washing my face, I simply had to laugh at myself in the mirror, thinking of all the dumb things I said and did the previous night. This time, the wrinkles I get in the corner of my eyes, when I smile, did not quite immediately pop back into smooth skin like they used to. They were slow to disappear and lingered around like little scars. This is a first. I knew something was off, when I did not get IDed at Waitrose, while buying the usual bottle of red. But oh well, why do we have a face, if not to collect wrinkles on it (<em>I will keep the whole who even invented botox conversation for an other time</em>). But what I mean to say is that an other year passed and it is time for sum ups - we shall reflect on what we put our energy into and to what it amounts. Happiness and fairness might be infinite goods, but energy definitely is limited. Same as time. Do we want to make half of the human population waste theirs on unnecessary fashion considerations in order to dodge unconscious bias? Would these resources not be better used, if we let them actually do their work and build whatever they want to build?</p><p>Even our free time is often eaten up by being part of the wrong half of the population. After my getaway in the country side, I arrived at the train station 20 minutes before set departure time. I thought perfect, I can have a a coffee, just after I pee. Except I had to wait in line for around 10 minutes for the toilets. Not only I could not enjoy an hot beverage anymore, but had to rush in and out of the cubical, stressing about the train. I have lost count of the amount of times I had to shot my glass of champagne at the interval during a play, because most of those 15 minutes have been spend walking to the furthest corner, where way too little toilets for women have been squeezed. And then waiting and waiting and waiting. </p><p>One of the most pervasive and common<a href="https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/09/180905140245.htm"> forms of gender discrimination </a>experienced daily by girls and women around the world is their inadequate access to toilets. World wide there is a massive shortage of female sanitary facilities. Everywhere. Including in our Western progressive bubble world. For some reason, we only build as many toilets as men need, in order to not queue. Public policy calculates and mandates how many toilets a place must have. The formula accounts for the time males spend using the bathrooms. But we have anatomical differences + at any point in time approximately 1/4 of women are menstruating. I wonder why do we choose to ignore these differences? Last time I checked, we do pay the same price for a theatre ticket and one would expect the same type of entertainment. Including the chitchats and hahas and ohlalas during the break. </p><p>Ranting on the internet about the many different ways being a women sucks in this world might seem like a waste of energy to some (like one of my dear male friends, who described my newsletter as annoying). </p><blockquote><p>The world is unfair in many ways, I should just deal with it. But I refuse to accept it. If the world is unfair, I will not live by its rules and neither should you. Slacking in the comfort of familiarity, or as Gen Zs would say “sometimes be like that”, is easy. But it has always been the ones who push themselves into uncomfortable positions, that changed the world. Because the world does change. Constantly. It is just a matter of who will push for the change and how will they shape it. </p></blockquote><p>Remember that it was an handful of courageous women gathering in dark basements, who plotted on how to force men to allow them to vote. They put literally their freedom and safety at risk and eventually prevailed. And today we all benefit from it. So, if nowadays, I might be considered an ugly, underf-ed, bitter feminist, who simply cannot get a man, may that be my sacrifice. I will not shut up about these things and will continue writing from the comfort of my cosy home, where nobody can arrest me for speaking up. Or at least for now. This is a privilege most of women around the world do not enjoy and we shall keep that mind. May we all be louder for them, too. </p><p>To conclude, what do penalty shoot-outs, fashion choices as a foundress and toilets have in common? They are all little tiny things that are part of our daily lives and which we do not even consciously notice anymore. But they are definitely draining our energy and shifting our focus away from what actually matters. Unnecessarily and little by little. At this point I would love to say - choose your battles and laser focus. Unfortunately, we do not have that privilege. These annoying hurdles are there, even if we choose not to see them. The little and the big things. You can change them in big and little ways (like sharing this newsletter with your besties, frenemies and mates ;). Not getting constantly angry at all these nuisances, but keeping them in mind and fighting them man by man is my strategy. </p><p>I am signing off this year knowing, that there are so many women out there, who are happy to build a love wall behind me. I just have to have the courage to ask. And I will make sure, that in the year to come, I will be part of as many love walls as I can, for other women, who make this world a better place. </p><p>until next year</p><p>xoxo</p><p>vulvarina </p><p>PS: I asked my brothers, if there is a name for this “love wall” in football. Ofc there is not. Ofc men do not speak of positive emotions, they shall not be named. Good thing there is a technical term for all the other things in this game. Dear boys, let’s do more tiki-taka as a strategy for when we communicate and interact with each other. Pass the ball, lean in, listen others out and please be part of our love walls. There is no war of the sexes here, we are all on the same team.</p><p>PS2: 📖<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/61089551-after-sappho">After Sappho</a> by <em>Selby Wynn Schwartz - </em>a collection of short stories about women, who chose to go against convention. In times when this meant much worse repercussions, than scarring away your sexist dating prospects.
