<p>Moikka from Helsinki, hi from London,</p><p>Last week, Slush, one of the biggest startup conferences, took place in Finland. Packed all my wool and cashmere and flew over. As if the cold wasn‚Äôt enough, the founders‚Äô festival on day 0 gave me the chills from the inside. Too many suits, too little dresses. At this massive party the female/male ratio was somewhere at 10/90. Were I competing for male attention, from a demand and supply POV, amazing. Ego boost. Except I was not there to shop for a boyfriend, nor receive recognition for my attractiveness. Not that I do not enjoy flirting, but there is a time and place. Like the after parties. </p><p>Next day, upon meeting some of the people from the other side of the conference aka the investors, I quickly realised why girls do not seem to be venturing into this foreign realms. One dude, in his mid forties, crushed the conversation I was having with one of his colleagues and began to mansplain about how much he wants his daughter to know that she can be an entrepreneur and how important role models are for that. All while interrupting me every three seconds and not making eye contact once. He carried on saying, that unfortunately in their portfolio they only have one female founded company. What a shocker. After three interrupted attempts of telling my story, I repositioned myself as listener in this conversation and started asking questions. One would think a wise and intelligent man with the ego the size of an elephant would be happy to give advice. Problem was, my questions were interrupted too and he just assumed he knew what I wanted to know, so I ended up listening to answers to dumb questions I would never ask. Turned around and left.</p><p>But who wants to read deploring stories of how sexism is ever so present in our lives. Boring + they are just anecdotes any self-infatuated mansplainer can refute with the power of a dismissive laugh. Let‚Äôs look at the data.</p><p>A Georgetown University <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/275005639_Influence_of_Communication_Partner's_Gender_on_Language">study</a> showed that men are <strong>33% more likely</strong> to interrupt when speaking to women, as opposed to while speaking to men. A Northwestern University <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2933016">study</a> showed that male Supreme Court Justices interrupt female Justices <strong>three times more often</strong> than they do with male Justices. Both studies showed that interruptions can be traced back to unconscious bias, which affects who we think is powerful or has high-status enough to not be interrupted. In healthcare, doctors <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11456245/">often interrupt patients</a> when they speak, especially female patients, but patients rarely interrupt doctors in return, except when they are women.</p><p>Young girls are thought to be polite and take turns when they speak. Boys are thought to assert dominance. We punish little girls for speaking too much or over adults, while we praise boys for being rebellious and getting it their way. Later in life these lessons do not go unnoticed. </p><blockquote><p>According to Deborah Tannen, a linguist at Georgetown University, an <a href="https://www.economist.com/prospero/2014/07/10/johnson-why-men-interrupt">additional reason</a> why men interrupt is because they talk to determine and achieve <strong>status</strong>. Women talk to determine and achieve <strong>connection</strong>. To use metaphors, <em>for men life is a ladder and the better spots are up high. For women, life is a network, and the better spots have greater connections.</em> Where are all the crypto bros who always talk about the power of network, decentralisation and wagmi? Please let them know they are actually just trying to mimic female characteristics, that the world slowly seems to acknowledge as more efficient, fairer and simply better. Let‚Äôs also give women credit for that and not rebrand them as the latest hot $hit men came up with.</p></blockquote><h5>üìñ<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18528190-men-explain-things-to-me">Men explain things to me</a> by <em>Rebecca Solnit</em></h5><p>The woman who coined the term ‚Äúmansplain‚Äù herself. A collection of essays, most infamous one about a man at a cocktail party, who asked her what she did for a living. She replied that she wrote books and described her most recent one, <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0142004103/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0142004103&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=gueamagofarta-20">River of Shadows: Eadweard Muybridge and the Technological Wild West</a>. </em>The man interrupted her soon after she said the word Muybridge and asked, "have you heard about the very important Muybridge book that came out this year?" He then waxed on, based on <strong>his</strong> <strong>reading of a review of the book</strong>, not even the book itself, until finally, a friend said, "that's her book." Oh boy, that must have been awkward.</p><h5>üóû<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/14/business/women-sexism-work-huffington-kamala-harris.html">The Universal Phenomenon of Men Interrupting Women</a> by <em>Susan Chira in the New York Times</em></h5><p>Men interrupting women happens at all levels, not just at the dinner table, when guys monopolise the conversation talking about other guys running after a ball, but also in boardrooms, political debates, at work and in private. Kamala Harris struck a nerve with ‚ÄúMr Vice President, I am speaking.‚Äù during a debate with Pence, who kept on interrupting her and the female moderator. Women across the US took to <a href="https://time.com/5898144/men-interrupting-women/">twitter</a> and shared how frustrating it is having men constantly and shamelessly speak over them. </p><p>It is funny how women are often mocked for talking too much, when in reality, it is the men who simply cannot shut up. And listen. This makes me think of a similar myth around marriage. <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/may/25/women-happier-without-children-or-a-spouse-happiness-expert">Data</a> clearly shows that married men are happier and their life expectancy goes up, while for women it is the opposite, but we still make lame jokes about how desperate women are to find an hubby. Morale of the story - stay single ladies. Until you find one that really sweeps you off your feet ofc. And boys, put some more effort in. This cannot be it. Become an overachiever when it comes to how good of a boyfriend you are, please. Nobody really cares about those excel skills.</p><h5>üé§<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IyuUWOnS9BY">Beyonc√© - ***Flawless</a> ft. Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie</h5><p>Queen B embellishes the song with a strong passage from Chimamanda‚Äôs powerful essay ‚Äú<em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22738563-we-should-all-be-feminists">We should all be feminist</a></em><a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22738563-we-should-all-be-feminists">‚Äù</a>. These two have very different approaches to feminism, but both respect each other and understand the their goal is the same, they just have different means. United in diversity. <em>Recommendation provided by Marie M - follow her <a href="https://www.instagram.com/marielatuerie/">here</a>.</em></p><blockquote><p>The lack of confidence is not in our heads. Our confidence is crushed at home, in school, in the media and at work. Interrupting someone while they speak is the human equivalent of roaring louder and asserting dominance. Allegedly, we are the smarter animals, so let‚Äôs start behaving accordingly. Not because women demand it or because it is fair, but because data shows a world co-led by women is a much better place. More wealth, more glory, more happiness. For everyone. </p></blockquote><p>Humans often act as if life satisfaction was a finite resource we have to compete for. This might have been true in a time, when survival was the goal and calories intake the struggle. If you are reading this, it means you are probably privileged enough to not have to worry about such things. We should stop acting as if our physiological needs are not met. Happiness is not a finite resource. You are trying to meet your psychological and self fulfilment needs. In that race you are on your own. Do not create a fake sense of competition, where there is none and stop punishing women for your own insecurities. We are in a bubble and the above is still not true for the majority of the human population, but it is time we acknowledge our privilege and put it to good use.</p><p>Are these the thoughts of a naive young woman? No. These are rational arguments backed by data. Minus an inflated ego and the ook-ook eekh-eekh mindset (apparently that is onomatopoeia for monkeys). </p><blockquote><p>I left the conversation mentioned at the beginning of the article feeling ashamed, little and as if I do not belong there. I had to quickly pick myself up, rationalise that that dude was the problem and not my lack of skill or charisma and keep going. This is additional work women have to put in on a daily basis. And we still rock it. Is it fair? No. Do I always have the energy to do it? Unfortunately, no. Should I ever have a daughter, do I want her to deal with this? Also, no. It gets in the way of actually getting stuff done. Imagine having worldwide an additional 100% geniuses putting their minds to solving climate change, poverty and other misery springs, without having to worry about being heard. We would already live in some really happy utopian world.</p></blockquote><p>Practical advice: girls, do not fear to point out, when someone else interrupts you and make clear you are not giving up your space. There is no shame in telling a rude person, they are being rude. Boys, watch your mouths. Be aware of how often you interrupt someone when they speak, especially if <em>they </em>are female. Are you truly so much smarter and funnier?</p><p>To end on an optimistic note, at Slush, the Finnish Prime Minister, Sanna Marin, was interviewed by the conference‚Äôs CEO, also a woman. This talk is anecdotal data on how great a world led by women could be. Ms Marin took responsibility for mistakes a different generation of politicians made and pledged to do better. Learn from their mistakes and build a better place for generations to come. Rule number one for any politician is never acknowledge you were/are wrong publicly. No political strategist would approve of such a speech, but she does politics on her own terms and seems to be winning. For all of us. She plans long term and contributes towards humanity, not her own short term gain. That truly means building a legacy. So, stop kidding yourself that stepping on the ones next to you, will lift you up.</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://vulvarina.substack.com/p/vulvarina-iv?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://vulvarina.substack.com/p/vulvarina-iv?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe338f8a1-e69c-4078-b5aa-4fd330ffaeb3_1125x1134.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe338f8a1-e69c-4078-b5aa-4fd330ffaeb3_1125x1134.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe338f8a1-e69c-4078-b5aa-4fd330ffaeb3_1125x1134.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe338f8a1-e69c-4078-b5aa-4fd330ffaeb3_1125x1134.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe338f8a1-e69c-4078-b5aa-4fd330ffaeb3_1125x1134.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e338f8a1-e69c-4078-b5aa-4fd330ffaeb3_1125x1134.jpeg" width="1125" height="1134" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/e338f8a1-e69c-4078-b5aa-4fd330ffaeb3_1125x1134.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1134,&quot;width&quot;:1125,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:208326,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:true,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe338f8a1-e69c-4078-b5aa-4fd330ffaeb3_1125x1134.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe338f8a1-e69c-4078-b5aa-4fd330ffaeb3_1125x1134.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe338f8a1-e69c-4078-b5aa-4fd330ffaeb3_1125x1134.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fe338f8a1-e69c-4078-b5aa-4fd330ffaeb3_1125x1134.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw" loading="lazy"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><div><hr></div><p>If you know others, who you think would enjoy this newsletter, please forward this email to them too.
