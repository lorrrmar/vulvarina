<p>Hi gals,</p><p>Welcome to the pack! I am v grateful for your early support and will put my best efforts in turning vulvarina into your go to superhero when you need a bit of a push,  a confidence boost or want to bounce some ideas off other incredible humans around here. Together we are stronger and I really hope you will use this as a mean of elevating and supporting each other. Eton boys, the girls are united and coming for your high positions. </p><p>Cultivating a culture of mutual support, fellowship and solidarity among women is our goal, along internalising that being girly can be a good thing and we do not have to behave like bros to be cool. Be true to yourself, define what being human is for you and recognition will come from the right places. </p><p>You are going to receive a biweekly newsletter with a few thoughts, bits and bobs that I am consuming and hope to provide you with some enjoyable and useful content. Feel free to upload what you are reading in the <a href="https://www.vulvarina.com/">library</a> on our website and message me about your thoughts on these materials. </p><h5>üìñ&nbsp;‚Äù<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/36200494-be-more-pirate">Be more pirate</a>‚Äù by Sam Conniff Allende </h5><p>Rewrite the rules. Or how to take on the world and win. Why rebelling against the establishment pays off and how to get into this type of good trouble. Especially women often have to break long established rules and ‚Äútraditions‚Äù. The book provides a set of questions, which will help you find out what keeps you back from achieving your goals, who do you have to take down and which rules you have to break on your way. Do not be afraid of sparking change and do not obey by rules that are not fair.</p><p><em>I‚Äôd rather be a pirate, than join the navy</em>. - Steve Jobs</p><h5>üóû‚Äù<a href="https://hbr.org/2004/04/do-women-lack-ambition">Do women lack ambition</a>?‚Äù in the Harvard Business Review</h5><p>Women tend to shrink their accomplishments and assign their success to luck, rather than their skills.

(who is also the artist behind our logo - check out her art <a href="https://www.instagram.com/celine.jhan/">here</a>). In this episode (EN), the host interviews Carol Gilligan about her book ‚ÄúWhy does patriarchy persist?‚Äù. The conversation provides some insight into why sexism is bad for men too and how the price men are paying for this construct of masculinity is huge. And violence is part of that.</p><h5>üé¨<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0106226/">The Age of Innocence</a></h5><p>Watch it for 19th century New York high society vibes and what can come out of inaction and postponement.

Without them pushing me and constantly checking on me, I would have never even started. Please keep on asking me uncomfortable questions, this is just the very beginning and there still is much work to do. I am so grateful to have you two by my side.</p><p><em>Don't judge each day by the harvest you reap, but by the seeds you sow. </em>- L. Stevenson</p>
