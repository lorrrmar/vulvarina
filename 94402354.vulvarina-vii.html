<p>Good morning 2023,</p><p>I hope you spend the night between the years with your loved ones, getting a kiss from a stranger or cosied up in bed on your own - whatever made you happiest (<em>thank you to everyone working on such nights, enabling the rest of us to have a blast and keeping the world going</em>). One thing we probably all have in common is that we starred at a clock for the last ten seconds of the year. Be it digital, or the good old analogue Rolly on oneâ€™s wrist. Counting down till midnight. Tick-tock-tick-tock. For some reason we are obsessed with clocks and watches. Even though time is relative.</p><p>Ignoring the physical and philosophical aspect of this, one reason why we came up with the construct of time might be the fact that our bodies have internal clocks. Chronobiology looks at our circadian rhythms - when do we sleep, when are we awake, when are our gut bacteria most active, when do our cells regenerate, when are our hormones peaking etc. To throw in some etymological knowledge - circadian comes from the two Latin words <em>circa</em> (around) and <em>diem</em> (day), describing the solar cycle of one day. In our culture, the sun has mostly been compared to male power - from Greek mythology to modern religion (<em>weirdly, for Germans the sun is feminine and the moon masculine, but who gets them anyways</em>). We all know how important it is to be in sync with our biological clock. Skip one nightâ€™s sleep and you feel hungry, but too sick to even look at food. Being jet lagged is the most spread first-world-problem problem. </p><p>But in this universe there are more celestial bodies, besides the sun. One of them being the previously mentioned moon. Which coincidentally needs 28 days to go through all its phases. What other rhythm in nature takes roughly the same time? Menstruation! Women shed their uterus lining and their unused eggs every month, after going through four different hormonal phases. Follicular phase, ovulation, luteal  and menstrual phase.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40d6041-5638-4597-b2be-8bdabf45993c_3024x4032.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40d6041-5638-4597-b2be-8bdabf45993c_3024x4032.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40d6041-5638-4597-b2be-8bdabf45993c_3024x4032.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40d6041-5638-4597-b2be-8bdabf45993c_3024x4032.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40d6041-5638-4597-b2be-8bdabf45993c_3024x4032.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f40d6041-5638-4597-b2be-8bdabf45993c_3024x4032.jpeg" width="276" height="367.9368131868132" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/f40d6041-5638-4597-b2be-8bdabf45993c_3024x4032.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1941,&quot;width&quot;:1456,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:276,&quot;bytes&quot;:1992670,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40d6041-5638-4597-b2be-8bdabf45993c_3024x4032.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40d6041-5638-4597-b2be-8bdabf45993c_3024x4032.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40d6041-5638-4597-b2be-8bdabf45993c_3024x4032.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ff40d6041-5638-4597-b2be-8bdabf45993c_3024x4032.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>Notice how when I was writing about the circadian rhythm, everything sounded so scientific and accurate, while as soon as I was speaking about the moon and periods, for many of us this article started sounding unserious or a bit dreamy-vague? </p><p>Just because we have not gathered enough data about a specific subject, it does not mean it is just some esoteric nonsense. In 2017, Jeffrey Hall, Michael Rosbash, and Michael Young received the Noble Price for uncovering which gene determines the particularities of our circadian cycle. We are basically coming to terms (backed by data and solid scientific research) with the fact that our bodies are connected to nature and the universe. We need to live accordingly to our environment. And we have been living according to it in an instinctual manner. </p><blockquote><p>So how comes we do not know more about the cycle half of the human population follows, in addition to the circadian one? The answer to that is that we do not direct enough of our resources to study and explore female related biology. </p></blockquote><p>Alisa Viti picked two passages from a school level biology book, describing the human reproductive system. First one refers to male fertility:</p><p><em>The testes are powerhouses of efficient production. They produce two to three hundred million spermatozoa daily. Each sperm itself is a perfect delivery system for genetic material to the eggâ€”the shape, the tail, the nutrients that give the sperm its mobility and motilityâ€”all in perfect concert for its ultimate goalâ€”getting to the egg first to share genes.</em></p><p>Oh, but how powerful and incredibly amazing are the testes? Restlessly producing genetic material and perfectly delivering it to the egg. </p><p>Following paragraph describes female fertility:</p><p><em>After the development and release of one egg from the ovary, the female reproductive process is twofold. In the case of conception, the lining thickens, the uterus grows, the placenta forms, and the miracle of life begins in the safe confines of the womb. If not, then the lining sheds and is lost and the cycle begins again.</em></p><p>Do you notice the change of tone? Our passive, boring eggs just get released and our uterus either thickens or not. How uninspired. Language does shape. Our daily lives, our subconscious biases, the research we put our money in, etc. Alone the way female biology is described makes us yawn. </p><blockquote><p>But if living against the circadian clock has such unhealthy and uncomfortable consequences, what are the repercussions of not living in sync with our menstrual cycle? Abdominal pain, tiredness, moodiness, PMS. Women are not broken or weak. We just know too little about our bodies and how to handle them. </p></blockquote><h5>ðŸ“–<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/52714639-in-the-flo">In the FLO</a>: A 28-day plan working with your monthly cycle to do more and stress less by <em>Alisa Vitti</em></h5><p>This book lays out which diet, types of exercise and work are most suitable during each of the four phases of the menstrual cycle, in order to optimise your productivity, boost your mood and nurture your body. Very interesting read, but for me, implementing these guidelines in the daily life is a bit of a challenge. And a New Yearâ€™s resolution.</p><blockquote><p>Letâ€™s not forget about the men in this world though. Funnily, they also have an hormonal cycle. And luckily for them, it coincides with our all circadian cycle. In a 24-hours rhythm, menâ€™s bodies go through hormonal fluctuations, which affect their mood and energy. Men are also human and highly sensitive to their hormones, but our world is designed to work around their cycles. Fortunate bastards. </p></blockquote><p>If I wasn't in my luteal phase, I might be laughing. But it is quite sad how women are often dismissed, laughed at or even worse, told they are unfit for specific tasks, because they are hormonal and crazy. Easy to throw stones, when the world literally works around you. </p><p>Brief description of the male hormonal cycle: testosterone peaks during the morning, which means energy, confidence, impulsiveness, temperament and high sex drive. It then decreases throughout the day, with the afternoon striking a golden balance. That is a really good time for getting work done, as they will be&nbsp;focused and more open to teamwork. In the evening, when testosterone hits its lowest point, it is common for energy to dip with it, bringing in calmer emotions and tiredness, along with lower sex drive. </p><p>All that energy to propel awake and ready to attack your day early in the morning, a long afternoon of productivity and hyper-focus, and then tiredness starts to settle in just as you clock off from work just perfectly matches the standard work day. And it feels so natural that you are probably wondering how else could it be? Well, there are 2432534 other ways that we could structure our work lives.</p><p>Gals, remember, there are boys <a href="https://www.closmonicord.com/blogs/news/la-lune-et-le-vin">making wine</a> in sync with the moon and selling it for good money to some hip Parisians and Berliners. You are not crazy, nor wrong, nor weak for needing to live in sync with your second internal clock, which in some serene way is linked with the moon. Our bodies are happiest and healthiest, when we wake up and go to sleep with the sun and we would probably get rid of all menstrual pains, if we would dance to the other rhythm of the nature, too.</p><p>Boys, the main takeaway for you is, I guess that, if you do not feel very much into getting intimate after a romantic dinner with your partner - that is totally fine. Your body is designed to crave sex in the morning. Do not push yourselves. Listen to your body and go for the morning fun. If she is still there. Somewhat hilarious how the only social construct that is not aligned with the male hormonal cycle is around intercourse. And for that we have alcohol (which ofc enhances testosterone levels).</p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://vulvarina.substack.com/p/vulvarina-vii?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Share&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://vulvarina.substack.com/p/vulvarina-vii?utm_source=substack&utm_medium=email&utm_content=share&action=share"><span>Share</span></a></p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://vulvarina.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://vulvarina.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><p>If you know others, who you think would enjoy this newsletter, please share this with them, too.
