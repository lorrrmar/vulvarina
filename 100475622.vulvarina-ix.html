<p>Good morning,</p><p>At the ball mentioned two weeks ago, I was determinately looking out for some sexist behaviour to find a fun story - what better place than a conservative mob of privileged people. Ironically, I found the biggest chauvinist within me. <em>Or did I</em>?</p><p>Being back in Vienna reminded me of how much I enjoy a certain type of chivalry and how often I involuntarily frown upon guys who do not open the door for me or help me with my coat in winter. I catch myself making a weird face, but then I quickly remember I am a strong independent woman and I do not need anyone to do these things for me. The conflicting thoughts incentivised me to do some research on how chivalry can be reconciled with feminism. Because I want the best of both worlds. Or as some would say, I want to run with the hares and hunt with the hounds.</p><p>Chivalry calls for curtesy and protectiveness towards women, whereas feminism demands equal rights between women and men. Both mean respect in different ways. But it is not that simple. It appears that at the moment there are two camps. Camp <em>yes hold the door for me</em> argues that these little gestures are nothing more than signs of respect and appreciation towards women, with which of course there is nothing wrong, but is only half of the story. The opponents bring forward arguments citing the historical origins of the customs and reinforcement of stereotypes that hurt women. The expression <em>the</em> <em>fair sex</em>, which obviously implies weak and helpless, does no good when trying to assert yourself at work and climb up the career ladder in a competitive and meritocratic world. Do or die. Eat or be eaten.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb6c4a1e-1703-48c6-9c44-7c904ce6056e_1024x768.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb6c4a1e-1703-48c6-9c44-7c904ce6056e_1024x768.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb6c4a1e-1703-48c6-9c44-7c904ce6056e_1024x768.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb6c4a1e-1703-48c6-9c44-7c904ce6056e_1024x768.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb6c4a1e-1703-48c6-9c44-7c904ce6056e_1024x768.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cb6c4a1e-1703-48c6-9c44-7c904ce6056e_1024x768.jpeg" width="1024" height="768" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://substack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/cb6c4a1e-1703-48c6-9c44-7c904ce6056e_1024x768.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:768,&quot;width&quot;:1024,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:117338,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb6c4a1e-1703-48c6-9c44-7c904ce6056e_1024x768.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb6c4a1e-1703-48c6-9c44-7c904ce6056e_1024x768.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb6c4a1e-1703-48c6-9c44-7c904ce6056e_1024x768.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fcb6c4a1e-1703-48c6-9c44-7c904ce6056e_1024x768.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p>An other closely tided subject is that of etiquette, which is notorious for being used as a mechanism to internalise sexism. Think how we are supposed to cross our legs - movement that has been proven to communicate a very defensive and rather closed attitude, an attitude of taking less space. Girls are never supposed to say no, when a boy asks for a dance. Never be too loud, stay agreeable. Be elegant. Drop those opinions and put on a smile.</p><p>When it comes to these matters, I tend to believe there is more than a black and white story. It is not the good manners of not speaking over others or showing consideration towards how others feel that are problematic. It is how these rules have been instrumentalised to oppress women and how non-obedience has only been penalised for women. </p><blockquote><p>In respect to chivalry, the trouble is that <em>we perceive showing emotional vulnerability and physical weakness as weakness in general.</em> </p></blockquote><p>This might have been true some time ago, but not anymore. We do not have to fend for ourselves and protect our homes with pitchforks. We have law enforcement units and courts. We have understood that speaking about your feelings can keep us mentally sane. Some have therapists, some spam their besties. As a society we have developed and it only makes sense to keep the best of both worlds - the old, traditional one and the young, awaken one. Good manners and courtesy are definitely worth recycling and repurposing. </p><p>Initially, I considered, one must clearly differentiate between the personal and professional context. And that we should all behave according to the social situation we find ourselves in. Upon closer inspection, I changed my mind. I perceive the little gestures of chivalry in the first place as politeness, sometimes affection and simply put, kindness. Why should we not be able to be polite and kind to our coworkers? I have absolutely no problem with a male coworker holding the door for me. If I am quicker to the door, I will hold it for him. In this case, we are talking politeness + pragmatism. Because at work, efficiency, while maintaining human decency should be the goal. Showing kindness should not be prohibited, but we probably will, if we are too dumb to understand and update our actual motivations.</p><p>A thing that changes when it comes to friends and lovers is that these gestures also have an affection component. <em>Note: considering the whole love language theory, probably not for everyone though. </em>A few months ago, I went to a techno rave with a male friend and at some point a guy standing behind me started dancing really close to me and pretended it was because of the lack of space. After I turned around three times and gave him some death stares without success, my lovely friend asked, if I wanted to swap places. And we did, because this was an easy short term solution for dealing with an intrusive self entitled misogynist. One cannot be a social justice warrior at all times. Sometimes you just want to enjoy the time with your friends. </p><p>During this episode, I felt very protected and cared for. My friend did not offer to swap places, because he thinks I am weak and cannot deal with an idiot in a club, but because he wanted to spare me the hustle of it. Make my life easier and show he cares for me. He proves he sees me as an equal by listening to my arguments in contradictory conversations, giving what I say a proper thought and reading this newsletter, among others. </p><blockquote><p>Just because something is gender stereotypical, we do not have to discard of it in the name of equality. What we actually seek is equity. Acknowledging our differences and accounting for them. </p></blockquote><p>In the friends and lovers case, I also do think that the pragmatism is replaced by the type of energy and love language the two protagonists share. And this has nothing to do with their gender. Some guys like to be mothered and looked after, others prefer to play the role of the independent tough boy. Some girls enjoy the grand chivalrous gestures or being the damsels in distress, while others are rather keen on skipping this <em>bullÂ§hit,</em> as they would probably call it and expect and display affection in different ways. Roles can be reversed sometimes. And that is perfectly normal.</p><blockquote><p>It is time, we separate the good from the bad and update our conventions. And it is quite easy, once we understand and accept that our cognitive potency and emotional needs have nothing to do with our gender. </p></blockquote><p>In addition, we will hopefully never be just robots, who have no inter human dynamics or chemistry, so we need to learn how to navigate these in a way that nurtures us individually and our relationships, rather than fitting in one stencil, that seems to be one-size-fits-none. Stop associating <em>typically</em> female traits with weakness, insipidity and inferiority might be a good start. More of the men who have those traits and energy might feel safer to live them out. </p><p>So, what do you think - can chivalry and feminism co-exist? This topic is very much work in progress for me too and I would love to hear some opinions.
