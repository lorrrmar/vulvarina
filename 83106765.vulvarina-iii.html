<p>Morning London, morning world,&nbsp;</p><p>Last week I went to a friendâ€™s of friendsâ€™ cousinâ€™s house party. Inevitably, someone asked me who am I. Though question, donâ€™t we all constantly try to find this out? When I do not know how to define something, I resort to analogies. So I quickly thought of who my role models are, who are the people I aspire to be like. Only men came to my mind - happens in more instances than I would wish. The feminist in me got angry. How can it be that not a single woman has previously achieved what I dream of? How can I not know of those who have? Do I wish for the wrong things? Am I unfit for the tasks needed to be completed in order to get what I want? Will I have to live an incomplete life because I will have to settle for less? Absolute panic. Took a deep breath and did some research. It turns out that the lack of role models does impact your ability to dare to dream and act accordingly to your dreams.&nbsp;</p><div><hr></div><p>It all begins with fairytales. Boys are typically adventurous, rescuers, fighters and capable, they symbolise ingenuity and perseverance. Female characters are represented as victims, seldom triumph, if not beautiful, passive, weak, submissive and dependent to male figures. Moreover - fact that bothers me most - women are taught to play against each other. Cinderella is friends with mice and birds, rather than other women. Her evil sisters and the rest of the village compete against her. Snow Whiteâ€™s step mum also has it out for her. <em>Mirror, mirror on the wall, who is the most beautiful of them all?</em> Because of course there can only be one absolute babe winning THE only perfect guy in the world. <em>A girl should be two things: beautiful and dumb. </em>Thanks, Fitzgerald. The stories we tell reward women for being pleasant, good-looking, staying in their corner and always putting themselves last when it comes to guys, but first when other evil women cross their paths.  </p><p>In movies <a href="https://womenintvfilm.sdsu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/2021-Its-a-Mans-Celluloid-World-Report.pdf">85% of protagonists</a> are still men and even when women are in the spotlight, there is always one guy that is her kryptonite and can turn her world upside down with the power of a smile. <s>Next time you watch a film, pay attention to the amount of time women speak versus the men.</s> Actually, donâ€™t because it will become difficult to enjoy most of main stream movies. But next time you feel like an idiot, because your world is revolving around an idiot, take a deep breath and realise that that is how you have been taught to feel since you were a toddler. To be more accurate - brainwashed. In literature, males are represented 4x more often than females. That means, men are <a href="https://viterbischool.usc.edu/news/2022/04/ai-study-finds-that-males-are-represented-four-times-more-than-females-in-literature/">400% more often</a> present in our tales than women, while only representing 50% of the human population. No wonder women so often forget about themselves and guys think they are the centre of the universe. </p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd43c9b9f-0ea9-4afc-b07b-73058a3c2dfc_1125x1103.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd43c9b9f-0ea9-4afc-b07b-73058a3c2dfc_1125x1103.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd43c9b9f-0ea9-4afc-b07b-73058a3c2dfc_1125x1103.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd43c9b9f-0ea9-4afc-b07b-73058a3c2dfc_1125x1103.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd43c9b9f-0ea9-4afc-b07b-73058a3c2dfc_1125x1103.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d43c9b9f-0ea9-4afc-b07b-73058a3c2dfc_1125x1103.jpeg" width="1125" height="1103" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/d43c9b9f-0ea9-4afc-b07b-73058a3c2dfc_1125x1103.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1103,&quot;width&quot;:1125,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:1189213,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd43c9b9f-0ea9-4afc-b07b-73058a3c2dfc_1125x1103.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd43c9b9f-0ea9-4afc-b07b-73058a3c2dfc_1125x1103.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd43c9b9f-0ea9-4afc-b07b-73058a3c2dfc_1125x1103.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd43c9b9f-0ea9-4afc-b07b-73058a3c2dfc_1125x1103.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><p><a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/4132808?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents">Studies</a> even show that female students are more likely to choose a major in STEM when they are assigned a female professor instead of a male one. Retention of junior-level female employees is highly correlated with the number of female supervisors.&nbsp;Data clearly shows that <em>seeing is believing</em>. </p><p>Unfortunately, I still love to be the damsel in distress, saved by a prince charming. I fall for that 10/10. These stereotypes are so deeply engrained in me, that that is what I feel attracted to. Gotta work on that. But when it comes to business, I do not need to be condescended, rescued or take a step back and be the woman behind the hero man. In my professional life, I expect to be given credit for my achievements and be assessed based on my objective performance. Keep the matters of the heart apart from business.</p><h5>ðŸ“–<a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Ladies-Who-Punch-Trailblazing-Stories/dp/1785904760/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=Ladies+Who+Punch%3A+Fifty+Trailblazing+Women+Whose+Stories+You+Should+Know&amp;qid=1667832061&amp;sr=8-1">Ladies Who Punch</a> by <em>Yasmin Alibhai-Brown</em> </h5><p>If you need some inspo for women to look up to, this book tells the story of fifty pirate women, who refused to settle for what fairytales lay out for them. In addition, it is a good reminder that rights have not been given to women, but our female predecessors fought for them and often payed very high prices. </p><h5>ðŸ—ž<a href="http://genderforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/442013_FairyTales_Complete.pdf">Gender and Fairytales</a> edited by Prof. Dr. Beate Neumeier in the <em>Gender Forum</em></h5><p>If you want to go more in depth and read a proper analysis on why we need new stories for our children, look no more.</p><h5>ðŸŽ¤<a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2Y1UfqgZQ6BQIlhGqWGDZ1?si=3d8b6ef1dc6548f1">Leading Women </a>with <em>Rebekah Campbell</em> </h5><p>For more contemporary examples of women in leadership positions take a look at Campbellâ€™s episodes and find one that is closest to your field.

Not quite sure, but I am hopefully becoming a mix of Simone de Beauvoir, Marie Curie and Peggy Guggenheim. Girls and boys, who are the women you aspire to and inspire you? Make a list of three and keep them in mind. You canâ€™t get out of bed and go for that run or stop scrolling on insta and actually do the work? Think of them. Would Simone, Marie or Peggy waste their precious time with that type of cheap dopamine? Arguably not.&nbsp;Would they whine over some love stories gone wrong? Probably yes. But ah, who would we be without a little heart ache.</p></blockquote><p>After mentioning an incredible(ly sexist) Italian drama, we move onto the French goodies:</p><h5>ðŸŽ¬<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt8613070/">Portrait of a Lady on Fire</a> by <em>Celine Sciamma</em></h5><p>Movie without men. Marianne is commissioned to paint the wedding portrait of HÃ©loÃ¯se after so many male artists failed. The film is about the act of looking and the emotion and desire behind the look, plus the stunning landscapes of Brittany. Ending scene will give you goosebumps, even if you are a strong independent man. </p><div><hr></div><p>If you know others, who you think would enjoy this newsletter, please forward this email to them too.
