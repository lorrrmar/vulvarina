<p>After establishing why mutiny is good and often cool with ‚Äúbe more pirate‚Äù, it is worth taking a look at 1. in which ways patriarchy is still present and 2. why it makes sense from an economical, political and wellbeing point of view for humanity as a whole to eradicate it. We are currently playing a game where everyone loses potential welfare. In exchange for inflated male egos. No more. </p><h5>üìñ‚Äù<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/41104077-invisible-women">Invisible Women</a>‚Äù by <em>Caroline Criado-Perez</em></h5><p>This book armed me with data for otherwise very frustrating conversations. Frequently, I was confronted with women and men who did not want to acknowledge the need for feminism nowadays. On paper we have equal rights. There is even quotas. If you can only agree with the afore mentioned arguments, by all means, please keep on reading. Bare with me. This newsletter is for you. </p><p>In 1949, Simone de Beauvoir wrote ‚Äú<em>Representation of the world, (..), is the work of men; they describe it from their own point of view, which they confuse with absolute truth.</em>‚Äù, in 2019 Criado-Perez gathered the data to prove how true this still is and highlighted its socio-economic implications. She showed that in fact, we have built a world that by design is for men. From the little things such as the size of our smartphones, to big things such as drugs we use to cure our diseases and even the standards by which we diagnose diseases, are all tailored to the typical average male human. However, women are not just small men. The chemistry in female bodies works differently, as do the mechanics. Different types of hormones interact differently with specific drugs. Different ratios of muscular strength make us stronger in specific situations and weaker in others - which is relevant to e.g. automobile design. Next time you buy a car ask for a discount on the grounds that as a woman you are 71% more likely to get injured, 47% more likely to get seriously injured and 17% more likely to die in a car accident, because the manufacturers only crash test it on male dummies. One would think that men notice women have boobs. Not the engineers designing seatbelts. This and many more scary stats and fun facts are guaranteed to ignite extreme frustration, but also give you a sense of why feminism is not only for the ultra woke.</p><p>What is also worth mentioning is that both de Beauvoir and Criado-Perez do NOT insinuate that men are evil and set to make our lives hell (one wonders sometimes), but that due to lack of representation in decision making positions, we ended up only considering the needs and wants of half of the human population. In all male households you will seldom see a bin in the bathroom. Not because such men are inconsiderate of their female guests, but because they simply never need one, hence never think of it. Diversity matters because it is the only way we can build a by-design fair world for everyone.</p><div class="captioned-image-container"><figure><a class="image-link is-viewable-img image2" target="_blank" href="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd750845-9a3a-4c5d-be92-6bc5c7c463c3_1125x1402.jpeg"><div class="image2-inset"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd750845-9a3a-4c5d-be92-6bc5c7c463c3_1125x1402.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd750845-9a3a-4c5d-be92-6bc5c7c463c3_1125x1402.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd750845-9a3a-4c5d-be92-6bc5c7c463c3_1125x1402.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd750845-9a3a-4c5d-be92-6bc5c7c463c3_1125x1402.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"><img src="https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fd750845-9a3a-4c5d-be92-6bc5c7c463c3_1125x1402.jpeg" width="1125" height="1402" data-attrs="{&quot;src&quot;:&quot;https://bucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com/public/images/fd750845-9a3a-4c5d-be92-6bc5c7c463c3_1125x1402.jpeg&quot;,&quot;fullscreen&quot;:null,&quot;imageSize&quot;:null,&quot;height&quot;:1402,&quot;width&quot;:1125,&quot;resizeWidth&quot;:null,&quot;bytes&quot;:845490,&quot;alt&quot;:null,&quot;title&quot;:null,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;image/jpeg&quot;,&quot;href&quot;:null,&quot;belowTheFold&quot;:false,&quot;internalRedirect&quot;:null}" class="sizing-normal" alt="" srcset="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_424,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd750845-9a3a-4c5d-be92-6bc5c7c463c3_1125x1402.jpeg 424w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_848,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd750845-9a3a-4c5d-be92-6bc5c7c463c3_1125x1402.jpeg 848w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd750845-9a3a-4c5d-be92-6bc5c7c463c3_1125x1402.jpeg 1272w, https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fbucketeer-e05bbc84-baa3-437e-9518-adb32be77984.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Ffd750845-9a3a-4c5d-be92-6bc5c7c463c3_1125x1402.jpeg 1456w" sizes="100vw"></picture><div class="image-link-expand"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#FFFFFF" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="lucide lucide-maximize2"><polyline points="15 3 21 3 21 9"></polyline><polyline points="9 21 3 21 3 15"></polyline><line x1="21" y1="3" x2="14" y2="10"></line><line x1="3" y1="21" x2="10" y2="14"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><h5>üóû<a href="https://www.cmu.edu/ips/research/ips-journal/ips-journal-online/jps-issue-1_4_crookstond.pdf">Should Unpaid Labor be Included in GDP?</a> in the <em>Journal of Politics and Strategy</em></h5><p>Unpaid labor is defined as work that household members perform for free. Cleaning, cooking, child and elderly care, planning, the admin work everyone dreads. Even today, there are good chances that as a women in the UK you have on average 5 hours per week less free time due to chores than your male partner. Whole 5h every week - 21h per month, 260h per year, +10.000h in a life time. Time really compounds.</p><p>GDP is defined as the total value of goods and services produced. It is (literally) a manmade fantasy metric. Not a very conclusive one for that matter. Senator Robert Kennedy said ‚ÄúGDP measures everything, except that which makes life worthwhile.‚Äù It does not take into account any quality of life indicators, nor the sustainability of the economy - is it going to crash or not. If we insist on sticking with this at least questionable method for determining the success of a country, we should at least include all labor rendered. Stop glorifying a mum‚Äôs capacity to multitask and juggle job, kids, husband and household. Put a price on it and add it to the official stats.</p><h5>üé§<a href="https://www.imf.org/en/News/Podcasts/All-Podcasts/2021/10/20/jayati-ghosh">IMF Podcasts. Women in Economics: Jayati Ghosh on Unpaid Care Work</a></h5><p>In this podcast, Ghosh explains how our whole notion of productivity is skewed, because most care work is not captured in GDP. Factoring in this type of work is essential, as it influences policy making, which in turn massively impacts our daily lives. </p><p>Again, the economists who came up with <em>GDP = C + G + I + NX, </em>were probably not evil and loved their wives, but thought that dinner magically appears on their table and children grow on trees, since they were never confronted with these nuisances. </p><blockquote><p>‚ÄúIt‚Äôs a man‚Äôs man‚Äôs man‚Äôs world‚Äù gains a whole different meaning, doesn‚Äôt it? In those five hours that women are busy with what is supposed to be labor distributed among everyone in the household and public services, they could listen to this song for about 119 times. Every single week. </p><p>What would you do though? What is the goal you would like to pursue, if you would have more free time? Is work in your household evenly distributed? Or you just don‚Äôt mind doing the groceries, finding a cleaning person, decorating the place, booking holidays and coordinating dinner with friends? Does that really relax you or are there other ventures you would like to invest your time in? Don‚Äôt forget - <em>compounding</em>. </p></blockquote><p>For the fun part this week:</p><h5>üé¨<em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2358891/">La Grande Bellezza</a></em><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2358891/"> by Paolo Sorrentino</a> </h5><p>I absolutely love this movie. It is not even 10 years old and the few women that make an appearance are some kind of nice-to-have accessories. Of course a man can live an exciting and fulfilling life. The woman he loved in his youth will always be there, dutifully waiting for him to be ready to be saved or supported. That the protagonist is male is not a bad thing, but the fact that most of stories we tell feature male protagonists is. Ah, this is a story for an other newsletter. </p><p>Ignoring these little details, the film truly is a piece of art and worth watching.
