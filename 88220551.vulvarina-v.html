<p>A few days ago, during my morning run, I spotted this shirtless guy running at a few meters from me. Before I realised, I was starring at him. Or at his six pack. Canâ€™t really remember. However, I soon noticed he saw my intrusive look and out of embarrassment, I quickly turned my head in the other direction, which only made things worse. So I started laughing. Long story short - my uterus, hormones and other sub intellectual instincts prompted me to behave like an animal and stare at this person performing every day activities, but my ratio told me to stop. <em>Although, he kind of was asking for it. </em>It was 5 degrees outside and he was running naked like a moving  Greek bust. Nota bene guys - this shall not serve as an excuse. He laughed back and we continued our runs, making the whole scene look like this perfect humans, perfect life ad for a random product nobody actually needs. </p><p>Some would argue, were it the other way around, feminists would cancel the dude and label him as an horrible predator, accuse me of double standards and hypocrisy. Why is that this type of encounters usually do not feel like TV commercials, when is the guy doing the starring? </p><p>Firstly, I quickly realised my behaviour might feel intrusive to the other person, so I stopped immediately. There were no indications of that coming from him, but also who am I to stare at random people? Men uncomfortably starring at me are still something I often struggle with and get so frustrated with the fact that I have no appropriate means to respond to it. I look away, sometimes wave at them or ask if they need something, depending on the situation. But I am still the intimidated one. </p><p>This leads me to the second reason why men starring give us the creeps. In terms of absolute strength, the average men tends to be much stronger than the average woman. Women have approximately a 41% lower grip strength than men, and <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/1d73695a-266b-11e6-8b18-91555f2f4fde">this</a> is not a sex difference that changes with age: the typical seventy-year-old man has a stronger handgrip than the average twenty-five-year-old woman. So we are just weaker, but in exchange we can grow babies inside us, which is what keeps this species alive, so deal with it. And make this world a place that accommodates us too. Not to diverge - instinctively, women are in a worse position come to an one-on-one combat. <a href="https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/violence-against-women">1 in 3 </a>women worldwide are subjected to gender violence. Meaning that even statistically, it makes sense to be worried when a brute stares your way, especially after making it clear you are feeling uncomfortable. Little note: these stats do not account for body composition, that can drastically improve your strength. Keep lifting, gals. Also, there is an entire debate around flight, fight or freeze - which deserves an article on its own.  </p><blockquote><p>But letâ€™s not dwell on facts and stats clearly showing men are way likelier to be predators. Letâ€™s focus on my misbehaviour and all the ways patriarchy is bad for men, too. </p></blockquote><p>To begin with the worse of it all, <a href="https://www.brgeneral.org/news-blog/2021/july/men-and-suicide-why-are-white-men-most-at-risk-/">70% of all suicides</a> are committed by males. Stereotypes put an immense pressure on men. Pressure to provide, to never need anything from anyone, to always be strong and invulnerable. This can make their life very lonely and sad, which obviously results in poor mental health. To make it even worse, women are <a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9675500/">twice as likely to suffer of depression</a>, but four times less likely to commit suicide. It appears that men value <strong>independence</strong> and decisiveness, and they regard acknowledging a need for help as weakness. Women value <strong>interdependence</strong>, they consult their besties and readily accept help. They consider decisions in a relationship context, taking many factors into consideration, and feel freer to change their minds. Again, childhood lessons show - see the <em>big boys donâ€™t cry </em>chapter<em>. </em></p><blockquote><p><a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1097184x14558237">Studies</a> show that men in more gender-equal societies are half as likely to be depressed and even have less chronic back pain. To top that, an other <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11199-007-9319-9">study</a> found that males with feminist partners reported greater sexual satisfaction, as well as women with partners who supported feminism. So basically <strong>feminists fight for better sex</strong>. Among other things. </p></blockquote><p>On the lighter side, over a glass of wine, a male friend told me about the struggle of <em>when to make a move</em> while on a date. This is something I never thought about, but apparently plagues men all over the world. Cannot really describe it in a deep, emotional way, as I have never experienced it, but does seem to add unnecessary additional stress to the daily life of guys. </p><h5>ðŸ“–<a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56758197-sad-little-men?from_search=true&amp;from_srp=true&amp;qid=0KXglX1OmG&amp;rank=1">Sad Little Men: Private Schools and the Ruin of England</a> by <em>Richard Beard</em></h5><p>Often, the men who end up in leadership positions are shaped by cruel boarding schools, where they are thought to suppress their feelings, only look out for themselves and empathy does not exist in their dictionaries. This is exacerbated by the trauma that often emerges from being separated from the loved ones at a young age. The book is somewhat symbolic for patriarchy - the privileged go to boarding school to gain skills and connections that later in life will even their path to success. This, however, comes at the cost of their emotional intelligence, which subsequently impacts their mental health and the ability to build healthy relationships. Fair trade? Would it only impact their personal life, let everyone choose. Unfortunately, these people end up shaping the world - through governments, central banks, regulatory bodies, big corps and other entities that tell us what and how to do. Similar to boarding schools, that come with advantages and disadvantages, patriarchy comes with a lot of privilege for males, but not only. </p><blockquote><p><strong>Often men are just confused.</strong> Their <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CiTi2d-vRUt/?igshid=MDJmNzVkMjY%3D">emotions</a> get mocked and denied from early on, they grow up watching their fathers betraying their mothers and dealing with fathers who do not know how to handle anger, or any type of emotion for that matter. Toxic masculinity is not something men choose, but is the result of being wounded and not acquiring any emotional intelligence skills, which results in deficiencies when it comes to human connections. Men, as all humans, deeply want to be loved and seek connection, so many of them are frustrated because they do not have the skills to do that in healthy ways. </p></blockquote><p>Equality of rights, as happiness, is not a finite good. We do not need Robin Hoods to take away from the wealthy and give to the impoverished. We need to shape an environment that accepts, enables and nurtures the freedom and happiness of all types of humans. For that to be reality, empathy and diversity are key. And again, this is not hippie wippie happy talk. In this case, funnily, <em>markets do always clear</em> and data decidedly shows that by pursuing these values, we are all better off. Including from a financial point of view. So, sorry capitalist pigs, no excuses there. </p><blockquote><p>It is highly unlikely that men, who almost all benefit from male privilege, will relinquish it for some potential future gain. In the end, we are all just weak humans, who dumbly value today more than tomorrow. Feminists have to in fact fight for a fairer and better world for everyone, even the ones opposing it. </p></blockquote><p>Recently, a friend was talking about her gym experience and the random dudes giving her unsolicited advice while training. She is a very straight forward person and would just tell them to shut up and get out of her way, but eventually it did got tiring and she stopped going to the gym, pursuing other sporty activities, in other environments. Will my guy stop going for a run in that area? Highly unlikely. So, guys, please be mindful of how much space you take. Through your actions and words. Do no take the <em>a person's freedom ends where another man's freedom begins </em>too literally. The boy who came up with this, actually meant <em>another</em> <em>person</em> or <em>human. </em>Women included. </p><p>Girls, take the space you deserve. Do not let dudes subtly bully you out of places you enjoy. Call them out and find allies, if you do not feel safe to do so on your own. It is extra work, but someone has to do it. If it is not us, it will have to be the generations to come. Postponing this helps no one. </p><p class="button-wrapper" data-attrs="{&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://vulvarina.substack.com/subscribe?&quot;,&quot;text&quot;:&quot;Subscribe now&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:null,&quot;class&quot;:null}"><a class="button primary" href="https://vulvarina.substack.com/subscribe?"><span>Subscribe now</span></a></p><div><hr></div><p>If you know others, who you think would enjoy this newsletter, please share this with them, too.
